# learningApp

# Introduction
Using git to track your commits and your IDE and test framework of choice, implement the following Android application requirements:

1. Parent can login themselves with username/password 
2. Parent can login their child without entering the child's username/password
3. Child can login themselves with username/password
4. Parent can logout
5. Child can logout, either leaving an active parent session or no sessions 


# Installation
Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

     https://github.com/maquadir/learningApp.git
  
# Architecture and Design
The application follows an MVVM architecture as given below

# Setup
# Manifest File
Since the app is going to fetch from json url .We have to add the following internet permissions to the manifest file.

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  
# Data Layer
Created a Collection in Postman. We will have to create a mock server off of the collection and use the apis in our android project
We have declared a API interface to invoke the api using Retrofit.Builder()
A ApiService class to handle api requests and a repository takes care of how data will be fetched from the api.

          val apiService = ApiService()
          val repository = Repository(apiService)
          
Invoke api url using Retrofit.Builder()

          Retrofit.Builder()
                .baseUrl("https://18e2d77a-1039-4ecf-8f70-14bcbabf3e47.mock.pstmn.io")
                .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
                .client(okHttpClient)
                .build()
# Model
A Model contains all the data classes. 
     
      AuthData
      BodyRequest
      Parent
      Student

# View Model
We set up a view model factory which is responsible for creating view models.It contains the data required in the View and translates the data which is stored in Model which then can be present inside a View through the observable Livedata.

# Coroutines
Coroutines are a great way to write asynchronous code that is perfectly readable and maintainable. We use it to perform a job of requesting data from the api.

# View
It is the UI part that represents the current state of information that is visible to the user.We are setting up the UI using Jetpack Compose

# Getting the data from the below apis
  
    parentLogin - /login
    childLogin - /login
    parent loggin in child - /login/student/
    child login using parent token - /loginchildtoken/

Signing in as parent displays the student ids associated with the parent.
Upon selecting one student - the student would be able to sign in without username and password.
Upon logout both parent and child sessions will be logged out.
